# Bohn_and_Magnasco
Reproduction of the optimal transport network model from Bohn and Magnasco

In addition to the network simulation, the code offers a fast-and-nifty way to construct large 
hexagonal lattices and associated adjacency matrices. For example, you can create a lattice with 100 nodes along each 
base of the hexagon in seconds *note: I would not attempt to visualize the simulation on a lattice this large 

Feel free to generate your own optimal transport lattices by adjusting the input paramters to the simulation method.
Users are able to change the source location and $$\gamma$$ values to visualize how current is delivered over the hexagonal
lattice network.

For examples of the output, see the images  folder.
