Reproduction of the optimal transport network model from Bohn and Magnasco

In addition to the network simulation, the code offers a fast-and-nifty way to construct large 
hexagonal lattices and associated adjacency matrices. For example, you can create a lattice with 100 nodes along each 
base of the hexagon in seconds *note: I would not attempt to run the simulation on a lattice this large
